Hey there! thanks for ordering a datapack on my fiverr services!

To add the music files make sure they are OGG files (If they're .wav or .mp3 you can convert them easily using tools like audacity)
go to the folder assets\sound\music

Replace "dragon_victory.ogg" with the victory music
Replace "dragon_loop.ogg" with the battle music

Then reload the resource pack

Send me a message if you're having trouble getting this to work
